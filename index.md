Real-world deployments of robots for healthcare and assistive applications have brought to light complex issues and unintended consequences [2, 7, 11]. For example, hospital delivery robots often generate invisible work for clinicians, like minding the robot (e.g., clearing pathways for the robot to navigate), coordinating their schedules around the robot’s, and even offering the robot manual support to successfully complete the simplest of tasks. These tasks are unpaid clinician labor akin to complex articulation work [20], and uncover unexpected interactions between healthcare robots and the healthcare system in which they operate. 

Similarly, disability-centered researchers from HRI, HCI, and feminist crip technoscience have critiqued assistive robots for inadvertently perpetuating systemic biases towards disabled people [3, 4, 6, 10, 18]. For example, Rizvi et al. [16] and Williams [24] have challenged the predominant focus on robots that place the burden of social inclusion on neurodiverse children by teaching them “socially appropriate” forms of communication instead of supporting wider acceptance of diverse forms of communication. This can occur because the experiences of disabled people are often oversimplified when considering the accessibility of assistive technologies [10]. 

Disability exists along a wide spectrum of physical, cognitive, sensory, and psychological impairments, which may fluctuate over time. Additionally, disabled people’s lived experiences are often shaped by multiple overlapping forms of marginalization like ableism, sexism, and racism [10, 21, 25]. An oversimplification of disability when developing assistive technologies may result in unexpected access conflicts, particularly when someone has multiple disabilities, or when technologies are used in spaces with differently disabled people [10, 12, 13]. For instance, Mack et al. [12] described the challenges of providing multimodal content for people with visual or hearing impairments, as this influx of information may be overwhelming for others. 

However, not all unexpected and unintended consequences are negative. For instance, Moxi [17], a hospital delivery robot closely co-designed with nurses, resulted in returning time to nurses to work at the top of their license and focus more on patient care [1, 5]. Similarly, many disabled people have formed communities around “crip hacking” and makerspace culture where they creatively repurpose technologies to accommodate their own access needs [8, 9]. 

Thus, in this workshop, we aim to explore the “downstream” effects of robots that support healthcare and assistive applications. Downstream effects [14, 22] include the long-term social and ethical consequences that emerge after robots are deployed, often extending beyond the designer’s or developer’s intentions. Such effects include how robots may reshape responsibilities and power dynamics over time. We will bring together speakers and panelists from a variety of backgrounds, including academia, industry, and government, to share their stories and experiences to help shape our understanding of what such downstream effects may look like.

In conjunction, we will ideate on “upstream” interventions to explore how we may mitigate negative downstream effects. Upstream interventions come from public health [23], and ideations therein involve early stage strategies that anticipate potential challenges, inequities, potential misuse, and other negative effects before deployment [15, 19]. In prior work, examples have included an increased emphasis on participatory research practices and implementing policy strategies. Our conversations in this workshop will help identify proactive interventions that ensure robots complement, rather than complicate, human care practices.

This workshop will draw from the collective, multidisciplinary and lived experiences of speakers, panelists, and attendees to engage in critical dialogue, and ideate actionable recommendations and considerations for HRI researchers.
